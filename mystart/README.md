# MyStart 🐍

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work in progress!

A lightweight, reusable, and no-dependency Python tool for configuration
management.

## What?

Think of it as **Ansible playbooks**, but simpler and more flexible, thanks to
the full power of Python.

- Use the `modules` directory to add your own scripts.
- All core utilities are available in the `util.py` file for easy reuse.
- Check out the examples provided in the `modules` directory to see how I use
it personally.

## How to test it?

```sh
python -m mystart
```
